## Compilation
Execute the following command in your terminal to compile the project:
`g++ -Wall --std=c++17 *.cpp -o main`

## Execution
Target the ./main executable created to run the program.

When the program is started, you will be met with the following options:

"
Input v to add vertex to graph
Input e to add edge between two vertices
Input r to remove a vertex from the graph
Input t to remove an edge between two vertices
Input c to clear existing graph
Input g to load example graph from assignment
Input p to print all vertices and edges in graph
Input d to use Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path and distance between two vertices
Input s to stop program
"

Type the corresponding letter into your terminal, and press enter to send the command.
Note that option g can be used to load the graph data structures provided by the final project instructions document.
Option p can be used to verify that the input graph is as intended. Use options v, e, r, and t to add or remove a vertex or edge, as needed.
When you run Dijkstra's algorithm on the graph with option d, the program will display its results and then terminate.
Run ./main again to experiment with more graphs.
